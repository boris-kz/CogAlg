''' Level 1 with patterns defined by the sign of quadrant gradient: modified core algorithm of levels 1+2.

    Pixel comparison in 2D forms lateral and vertical derivatives: 2 matches and 2 differences per pixel. 
    They are formed on the same level because average lateral match ~ average vertical match.
    
    Pixels are discrete samples of continuous image, so rightward and downward derivatives per pixel are 
    equally representative samples of 0-90 degree quadrant gradient: minimal unique unit of 2D gradient. 
    Such gradient is computed as the average of these two orthogonally diverging derivatives.
   
    2D patterns are blobs of same-sign quadrant gradient, of value for vP or difference for dP.
    Level 1 has 5 steps of encoding, incremental per line defined by vertical coordinate y:

    y:   comp(p_): lateral comp -> tuple t,
    y-1: ycomp(t_): vertical comp -> quadrant t2,
    y-1: form_P(t2_): lateral combination -> 1D pattern P,
    y-2: form_P2(P_): vertical comb and comp -> 2D pattern P2,
    y-3: term_P2(P2_): P2s are evaluated for termination and consolidation 

    postfix '_' denotes array name (vs. same-name element), prefix '_' denotes prior-input variable '''
