''' 
This is a principal version of 1D alg, with full overlap between difference patterns and match patterns, vs. exclusive dP | mP in line_x_POC. 
Initial match is defined as average_abs(d) - abs(d): secondary to difference because a stable visual property of objects is albedo 
(vs. brightness), and spatio-temporal stability of albedo itself has low correlation with its magnitude. 
Although an indirect measure of match, low abs(d) should be predictive: uniformity across space correlates with stability over time.
Illumination is locally stable, so variation of albedo can be approximated as difference (vs. ratio) of brightness. 
Spatial difference in albedo indicates change in some property of observed objects, thus should serve as an edge | fill-in detector. 
Magnitude of such change or lack thereof is more predictive of some ultimate impact on observer than magnitude of original brightness. 
Hence, match of differences and matches is defined here as min magnitude, vs. inverse deviation of abs(d) as match of brightness.
Cross-comparison between consecutive pixels within horizontal scan line (row).
Resulting difference patterns dPs (spans of pixels forming same-sign differences)
and relative match patterns mPs (spans of pixels forming same-sign match)
are redundant representations of each line of pixels.
form_pattern() is conditionally recursive, cross-comparing derived variables within a queue e_ of a above-minimal summed value.
This recursion forms hierarchical mPs and dPs of variable depth, which will be cross-compared on the next level of search.
In the code below, postfix '_' denotes array name, vs. identical name of array elements, 
and capitalized variable names indicate sums of corresponding small-case vars'''
