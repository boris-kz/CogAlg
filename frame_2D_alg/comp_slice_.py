'''
Comp_slice is a terminal fork of intra_blob.
-
It traces blob axis by cross-comparing vertically adjacent Ps: horizontal slices across an edge blob.
These low-M high-Ma blobs are vectorized into outlines of adjacent flat or high-M blobs.
(high match: M / Ma, roughly corresponds to low gradient: G / Ga)
-
Vectorization is clustering of Ps + their derivatives (derPs) into PPs: patterns of Ps that describe an edge.
This process is a reduced-dimensionality (2D->1D) version of cross-comp and clustering cycle, common across this project.
As we add higher dimensions (2D alg, 3D alg), this dimensionality reduction is done in salient high-aspect blobs
(likely edges / contours in 2D or surfaces in 3D) to form more compressed skeletal representations of full-D patterns.
