'''
comp_pixel (lateral, vertical, diagonal) forms dert, queued in dert__: tuples of pixel + derivatives, over the whole frame.
Coefs scale down pixel dy and dx contribution to kernel g in proportion to the ratio of that pixel distance and angle 
to ortho-pixel distance and angle. This is a proximity-ordered search, comparing ortho-pixels first, thus their coef = 1.  

This is a more precise equivalent of Sobel operator, but works in reverse, the latter sets diagonal pixel coef = 1 and scales 
contribution of other pixels up, in proportion to the same ratios (relative contribution of each rim pixel to g in Sobel is 
similar but lower resolution). This forms integer coefs, vs our fractional coefs, which makes computation a lot faster. 
We may switch to integer coefs for speed, and are open to using Scharr operator in the future.

kwidth = 3: input-centered, low resolution kernel: frame | blob shrink by 2 pixels per row,
kwidth = 2: co-centered, grid shift, 1-pixel row shrink, no deriv overlap, 1/4 chance of boundary pixel in kernel?
kwidth = 2: quadrant g = ((dx + dy) * .705 + d_diag) / 2, no i res decrement, ders co-location, + orthogonal quadrant for full rep?

def comp_pixel_hybrid(image):  # 3x3 kernel M and 2x2 quadrant G, see comp_pixel_versions file for other versions and more explanation
    '''
    M is defined in odd-sized kernels, and G in their even-sized quadrants, initially 2x2 quadrants in 3x3 kernels.
    Same as d in line_patterns, translated into 2D. 2x2 M is very close to G, but they are different in 3x3 and higher kernels.
    M is omnilateral relative to central dert because it's not directional and defines value of that dert,
    G is unilateral higher-derivation directional comparand, thus also higher-resolution to preserve direction 2x2
