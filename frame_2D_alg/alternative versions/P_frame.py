'''
    Pixel-level parameters are accumulated in contiguous spans of same-sign gradient, first horizontally then vertically.
    Horizontal spans are Ps: 1D patterns, and vertical spans are first stacks of Ps, then blobs of stacks.

    This processing adds a level of encoding per row y, defined relative to y of current input row, with top-down scan:
    1Le, line y-1: form_P( dert_) -> 1D pattern P: contiguous row segment, a slice of a blob
    2Le, line y-2: scan_P_(P, hP) -> hP, up_connect_, down_connect_count: vertical connections per stack of Ps 
    3Le, line y-3: form_stack(hP, stack) -> stack: merge vertically-connected _Ps into non-forking stacks of Ps
    4Le, line y-4+ stack depth: form_blob(stack, blob): merge connected stacks in blobs referred by up_connect_, recursively

    Higher-row elements include additional parameters, derived while they were lower-row elements.
    Resulting blob structure (fixed set of parameters per blob): 
    - Dert: summed pixel-level dert params, Dx, surface area S, vertical depth Ly
    - sign = s: sign of gradient deviation
    - box  = [y0, yn, x0, xn], 
    - dert__,  # 2D array of pixel-level derts: (p, dy, dx, g, m) tuples
    - stack_,  # contains intermediate blob composition structures: stacks and Ps, not meaningful on their own
    ( intra_blob structure extends Dert, adds fork params and sub_layers)

    Blob is 2D pattern: connectivity cluster defined by the sign of gradient deviation. Gradient represents 2D variation
    per pixel. It is used as inverse measure of partial match (predictive value) because direct match (min intensity) 
    is not meaningful in vision. Intensity of reflected light doesn't correlate with predictive value of observed object 
    (predictive value is physical density, hardness, inertia that represent resistance to change in positional parameters)  

    Comparison range is fixed for each layer of search, to enable encoding of input pose parameters: coordinates, dimensions, 
    orientation. These params are essential because value of prediction = precision of what * precision of where.
    Clustering is by nearest-neighbor connectivity only, to avoid overlap among the blobs.

    frame_blobs is a complex function with a simple purpose: to sum pixel-level params in blob-level params. These params 
    were derived by pixel cross-comparison (cross-correlation) to represent predictive value per pixel, so they are also
    predictive on a blob level, and should be cross-compared between blobs on the next level of search and composition.
