This project is deeply nested and organic, keep style, conventions and notation as is, unless you find clear improvements.
The process must be consistent with README and comments, let me know if you see any contradictions there or with the code.
Prioritize asking questions, conceptual clarity and consistency is more important than implementation details.
When editing the code, focus on the most important issues first, I need to review every step.
Ignore all code except frame_2D_alg' agg_recursion.py, comp_slice.py, slice_edge.py, frame_blobs.py
