This is a deeply nested and organic project, keep style, conventions and notation exactly as it is.
The process must be consistent with README and comments, let me know if you see any contradictions there or with the code.
Ask clarifying questions and suggest solutions rather than immediately editing the code.
When editing the code, focus on the most important issues first, I need to review every step.
Prioritize function and conceptual consistency above all.
The only active code is frame_2D_alg: agg_recursion.py, comp_slice.py, slice_edge.py, frame_blobs.py, intra_blob.py
