We need help with design and implementation of this algorithm, in Python. All contributions must be consistent with the principles introduced here. Unless you find some conceptual flaws or omissions, which would be even more valuable.  
This is an open project, I pay per contribution, or monthly once there is a track record. I have ~1M in liquid assets and fully expect to spend it on this project, although it's likely to be back-loaded.

Contributions:

2010: Todor Arnaudov, $600 for suggestion to buffer old inputs after search.
 
2011: Todor, $400 consolation prize for understanding some ideas that were not clearly explained here.

2014: Dan He, $600 for pushing me to be more specific and to compare my algorithm with others.

2016: Todor, $500 for multiple suggestions on implementing the algorithm, as well as for the effort.

Kieran Greer, $375 for an attempt to implement level 1 pseudo code in C#
