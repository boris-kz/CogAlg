            2D version of first-level core algorithm will have frame_blobs, intra_blob (recursive search within blobs), and comp_P.<br>
            frame_blobs() forms parameterized blobs: contiguous areas of positive or negative deviation of gradient per pixel. <br>   
            comp_pixel (lateral, vertical, diagonal) forms dert, queued in dert__: tuples of pixel + derivatives, over whole image. <br>
            Then pixel-level and external parameters are accumulated in row segment Ps, vertical blob segment, and blobs,<br>
            adding a level of encoding per row y, defined relative to y of current input row, with top-down scan:<br>
            <br>
            1Le, line y-1: form_P( dert_) -> 1D pattern P: contiguous row segment, a slice of a blob <br>
            2Le, line y-2: scan_P_(P, hP) -> hP, up_fork_, down_fork_count: vertical connections per stack of Ps <br>
            3Le, line y-3: form_stack(hP, stack) -> stack: merge vertically-connected _Ps into non-forking stacks of Ps <br>
            4Le, line y-4+ stack depth: form_blob(stack, blob): merge connected stacks in blobs referred by up_fork_, recursively <br>
            <br>
            Higher-row elements include additional parameters, derived while they were lower-row elements. Processing is bottom-up: <br>
            <br>
            from input-row to higher-row structures, sequential because blobs are irregular, not suited for matrix operations. <br>
            Resulting blob structure (fixed set of parameters per blob): <br>
            <br>
            - root_fork = frame,  # replaced by blob-level fork in sub_blobs <br>
            - Dert = dict(I, G, Dy, Dx, S, Ly), # summed pixel dert params (I, G, Dy, Dx), surface area S, vertical depth Ly <br>
            - sign = s,  # sign of gradient deviation <br>
            - box  = [y0, yn, x0, xn], <br>
            - map, # inverted mask <br>
            - dert__,  # 2D array of pixel-level derts: (p, g, dy, dx) tuples <br>
            - stack_,  # contains intermediate blob composition structures: stacks and Ps, not meaningful on their own <br>
            ( intra_blob structure extends Dert, adds crit, rng, fork_) <br>
            <br>
           
            Blob is 2D pattern: <br>
            <br>
            connectivity cluster defined by the sign of gradient deviation. Gradient represents 2D variation per pixel. <br>
            It is used as inverse measure of partial match (predictive value) because direct match (min intensity)is not meaningful in vision. <br>
            Intensity of reflected light doesn't correlate with predictive value of observed object:  <br>
            some physical density, hardness, inertia that represent resistance to change in positional parameters. <br>
            This is clustering by connectivity because distance between clustered pixels should not exceed cross-comparison range. <br>
            That range is fixed for each layer of search, to enable encoding of input pose parameters: 
            coordinates, dimensions, orientation. <br>
            These params are essential because value of prediction = precision of what * precision of where. <br> 
            frame_blobs is a complex function with a simple purpose: to sum pixel-level params in blob-level params. <br>
            These params were derived by pixel cross-comparison (cross-correlation) to represent predictive value per pixel, <br>
            so they are also predictive on a blob level, and should be cross-compared between blobs on the next level of search and composition. <br>

            prefix '_' denotes higher-line variable or structure, vs. same-type lower-line variable or structure <br>
            postfix '_' denotes array name, vs. same-name elements of that array <br>
