''' 
  line_patterns is a principal version of 1st-level 1D algorithm, contains following operations: 

- Cross-compare consecutive pixels within each row of image, forming dert_ queue of derts: tuples of derivatives per pixel. 
  dert_ is then segmented by match deviation, forming mPs, each a contiguous sequence of pixels that form same-sign m: +mP or -mP. 
  Initial match is inverse deviation of variation: m = ave_|d| - |d|, not min: brightness doesn't correlate with predictive value.

- Positive mPs: spans of pixels forming positive match, are evaluated for cross-comp of dert input param over incremented range 
  (positive match means that pixels have high predictive value, thus likely to match more distant pixels).
- Negative mPs: high-variation spans, are evaluated for cross-comp of difference, which forms higher derivatives.
  Both types of extended cross-comp are recursive: resulting sub-patterns are evaluated for deeper cross-comp, 
  same as top patterns.
- Median mPs: comp d sign (direction) -> seg_d, D is too weak for immediate comp_d, but may accumulate within same-sign segs.
  these forks may overlap, but then rdn computation is far more expensive. 

  If value of incremental range or derivation cross-comp over full pattern is low, but the pattern is long enough, then its dert_ 
  is segmented by (m-ave) for +mPs and d-sign match for -mPs. Value density of resulting positive segments (seg_Ps) is higher than 
  in full pattern: +mm_seg_ave_M = ave_M / 2, and same-d-sign seg_D is not sign-cancelled (+mm: flat seg, ds: directed seg?)
  Thus, positive m-segments are evaluated for local rng_comp, and positive d-segments are evaluated for local der_comp.     

  comp_d eval by D because match of opposite-sign ds is -min: low comp value, but adjacent dd signs may still match?  
  (match = min: rng+ comp value, because predictive value of difference is proportional to its magnitude, although inversely so)

  Initial bi-lateral cross-comp here is 1D slice of 2D 3x3 kernel, while uni-lateral d is equivalent to 2x2 kernel.
  Odd kernels preserve resolution of pixels, while 2x2 kernels preserve resolution of derivatives, in resulting derts.
  The former should be used in comp_rng and the latter in comp_d, which may alternate with intra_comp.
